Simulated Annealing (SA) is an algorithm used for combinatorial optimization problems. It is inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy, where a material is heated and then slowly cooled to achieve a stable structure. This algorithm follows a similar principle: it begins with an initial solution and iteratively explores neighboring solutions, accepting worse solutions with a certain probability to escape local optima. This probability is controlled by a temperature parameter, which decays over time according to a given cooling function. This cooling strategy prioritizes exploration of the search space when the temperature is high, as worse solutions are more likely to be accepted, while exploitation of promising solutions occurs as the temperature decreases.

SA is classified as a local search algorithm because it explores the solution space by making incremental modifications to an initial solution.
